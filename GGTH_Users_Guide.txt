# GGTH 1-Hour - User Guide

A machine learning system that predicts forex price movements using an ensemble of AI models.

This system is designed to use the 1 hour prediction on the EURUSD for fast trades and has shown 100% accuracy on the 1 hour prediction being filled within 120 hours (maximum). About 65% will close in the 1 hour window and another 25% within 24 hours.
It is designed to run without a stop loss because it will close the open trade in 120 hours. It will also use drawdown periods to average down the position to increase net profits knowing that it fills the prediction in 120 hours maximum
Run this on demo for awhile and you will that it preforms quite well and safely. Since it doesnt use a stop loss you will need to set the lot size as a static number and the averaging down lots. The biggest drawdown testing showed was 33%
So keep that in mind when deciding what percent to risk so you dont blow up your account.

Only enable the veto system if you feel its over trading. Otherwise the trend and rsi is enough to filter the trades properly

Good Luck

## Training Models

### Recommended First Training

1. Open the GUI (`run_ggth_gui.bat`)
2. Enter your symbol: `EURUSD` (or any pair)
3. Select **"Train ALL models (multi-TF)"**
4. Check these models:
   - ☑ LSTM
   - ☑ Transformer  
   - ☑ LightGBM
   - ☑ GRU  
   - ☑ TCN
5. Check **"Force retrain"**
6. Click **▶ Run**

**Training takes 2-4 hours.** You can leave it running overnight.

### Model Options

| Model | Speed | Accuracy | Recommended |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------|
| LSTM | Slow | High | ✓ Yes |
| GRU | Medium | High | Optional |
| Transformer | Slow | High | ✓ Yes |
| TCN | Fast | Medium | Optional |
| LightGBM | Fast | High | ✓ Yes |

## Understanding Output

### predictions_EURUSD.json

```json
{
  "1H": {
    "prediction": 1.08234,
    "change_pct": 0.045
  },
  "4H": {
    "prediction": 1.08301,
    "change_pct": 0.107
  },
  "1D": {
    "prediction": 1.08456,
    "change_pct": 0.251
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `prediction` | Expected price |
| `change_pct` | Expected % change (positive = up, negative = down) |

### Reading the Signals

| Condition | Signal |
|-----------|--------|
| All timeframes positive | Strong BUY |
| All timeframes negative | Strong SELL |
| Mixed signals | WAIT / No trade |

## Using with MetaTrader 5

### Simple EA Code

```mql5
// Read prediction file
string filename = "predictions_EURUSD.json";
int handle = FileOpen(filename, FILE_READ|FILE_TXT);

if(handle != INVALID_HANDLE) {
    string content = FileReadString(handle);
    FileClose(handle);
    
    // Parse and use predictions...
    // If change_pct > 0.05, consider BUY
    // If change_pct < -0.05, consider SELL
}
```

## Command Line Usage

```bash
# Train models (recommended method)
python unified_predictor_v8.py train-multitf --symbol EURUSD --models lstm transformer lgbm --force

# Make predictions continuously
python unified_predictor_v8.py predict-multitf --symbol EURUSD --continuous --interval 60

# Make one prediction
python unified_predictor_v8.py predict-multitf --symbol EURUSD

# Train for different pair
python unified_predictor_v8.py train-multitf --symbol USDJPY --models lstm transformer lgbm --force
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Python not found"
→ Reinstall Python, check "Add to PATH", restart computer

### "MT5 path not configured"
→ Run `setup_wizard.bat` again

### "Failed to download data"
→ Make sure MT5 is running and logged in

### "Macro data unavailable for DXY, SPX"
→ This is normal - your broker may not offer these. Predictions still work.

### "Model version mismatch" or "Cannot deserialize"
→ Retrain models with `--force` flag

### Predictions seem wrong
→ Retrain models: `python unified_predictor_v8.py train-multitf --symbol EURUSD --force`

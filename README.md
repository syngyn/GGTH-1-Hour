IMPORTANT - for the system to work properly you need to be logged into the community portal on your Metatrader 5 platform: Click TOOLS - OPTIONS - COMMUNITY - then login.

Note: the Ai models can be trained on any Forex pair you desire. I would suggest you backtest any new forex pairs and settings before using. To backtest you need to run the Generate backtest to create a file that will contain what prices AI would have predicted in that timeframe. Then it can use those predictions during the strategy tester run.

Good Luck!!
